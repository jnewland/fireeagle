    # Initialize a FireEagle Client. Takes an options Hash.
    #
    # == Required keys:
    #
    # [<tt>:consumer_key</tt>]       OAuth Consumer key representing your FireEagle Application
    # [<tt>:consumer_secret</tt>]    OAuth Consumer secret representing your FireEagle Application
    #
    # == Optional keys:
    #
    # [<tt>:request_token</tt>]           OAuth Request Token, for use with convert_to_access_token
    # [<tt>:request_token_secret</tt>]    OAuth Request Token Secret, for use with convert_to_access_token
    # [<tt>:access_token</tt>]           OAuth Token, either User-specific or General-purpose
    # [<tt>:access_token_secret</tt>]    OAuth Token, either User-specific or General-purpose
    # [<tt>:app_id</tt>]                 Your Mobile Application ID
    # [<tt>:debug</tt>]                  Boolean
    #
    # User-specific OAuth tokens tie FireEagle users to your application. As such, they are intended to be
    # distributed (with keys) to that user's mobile device and/or computer running your desktop or mobile client.
    # For web-based applications User-specific tokens will be retrieved by your web server where they should be
    # treated as private data. Take care to avoid releasing this data to the public, as the corresponding User's location
    # information may be inadvertently exposed. User-specific OAuth tokens should be considered the property of
    # your users.
    #
    # General-purpose OAuth tokens are tied to your application and allow you, as a developer, to make more
    # general (often batch-style) queries against FireEagle. As a result, allowing this token/secret combination
    # loose has the potential to reveal a much greater amount of personal data. In an attempt to mitigate this, we will
    # only grant general-purpose tokens to web applications (contact us with details, if you seek an exception). In
    # addition, we require developers to provide a restrictive IP range at registration time in order to further mitigate
    # the risk of general-purpose tokens being used inappropriately.
    #
    # In general, OAuth tokens should be considered sacrosanct in order to help us respect our users' privacy. Please
    # take this responsibility on as your own. If your Application Oauth tokens are compromised, FireEagle will
    # turn off your application service until the problem is resolved.
    #
    # If the Client is initialized without an OAuth access token, it's assumed you're operating a non-web based application.
    #
    # == Non web-based applications
    #
    # For non web-based applications, such as a mobile client application, the authentication between the user and
    # the application is slightly different. The request token is displayed to the user by the client application. The
    # user then logs into the FireEagle website (using mobile_authorization_url) and enters this code to authorize the application.
    # When the user finishes the authorization step the client application exchanges the request token for an access token
    # (using convert_to_access_token). This is a lightweight method for non-web application users to authenticate an application
    # without entering any identifying information into a potentially insecure application. Request tokens are valid for only
    # 1 hour after being issued.
    #
    # == Example mobile-based authentication flow:
    #
    # Initialize a client with your consumer key, consumer secret, and your mobile application id:
    #
    #   >> c = FireEagle::Client.new(:consumer_key => "key", :consumer_secret => "sekret", :app_id => 12345)
    #   => #<FireEagle::Client:0x1ce2e70 ... >
    #
    # Generate a request token:
    #
    #   >> c.get_request_token
    #   => #<OAuth::Token:0x1cdb5bc @token="ENTER_THIS_TOKEN", @secret="sekret">
    #
    # Prompt your user to visit your app's mobile authorization url and enter ENTER_THIS_TOKEN:
    #
    #   >> c.mobile_authorization_url
    #   => "http://fireeagle.yahoo.net/oauth/mobile_auth/12345"
    #
    # Once the user has indicated to you that they've done this, convert their request token to an access token:
    #
    #   >> c.convert_to_access_token
    #   => #<OAuth::Token:0x1cd3bf0 @token="access_token", @secret="access_token_secret">
    #
    # You're done!
